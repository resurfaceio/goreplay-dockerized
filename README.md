## Capturing network traffic

Our `network-sniffer` runs as an independent containerized application. It captures packets from network interfaces, reassembles them, parses both HTTP request and response, packages the entire API calls, and sends it to your Resurface DB instance automatically.

We use [GoReplay](https://github.com/resurfaceio/goreplay) to capture HTTP traffic directly from network devices in userspace. Think `tcpdump` or Wireshark but without having to go through any of the packet reassembly or parsing process yourself.

After modifying the `.env` file with the required [environment variables](#environment-variables), just run the following docker command in the host machine:

```bash
docker run -d --name netsniffer --env-file .env --network host resurfaceio/network-sniffer:1.3.0
```

The `--network host` option must be specified in to capture traffic from other containers (or non-containerized apps) running in the machine.

## Capturing encrypted traffic

When capturing traffic from secure connections, network analyzer applications will sit between the client and your application acting as middlemen. However, in order to read the encrypted traffic these applications will require you to load both keys and certificates, increasing the attack surface for potential MITM attacks â€”which is exactly the opposite intent of secure connections. At Resurface, security is our main concern, which is why we **strongly** advice against loading your TLS/SSL keys into any application that does this. None of our integrations support capturing traffic from secure connections, including `network-sniffer`.

Instead, we recommend running the `network-sniffer` container upstream, after TLS termination occurs. For example, if TLS termination occurs in a reverse proxy, like this:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7117255/224347366-ab1332d4-8632-4b67-af0f-a542f2d7255b.png"  width="500">

we suggest configuring the sniffer to capture from the backend applications directly. In this case, that means setting the `APP_PORTS` variable to `8080,3000,5432`.

If TLS termination occurs within the application itself, we recommend using any of our instrumentation-application loggers: [logger-java](https://github.com/resurfaceio/logger-java), [logger-python](https://github.com/resurfaceio/logger-python), [logger-go](https://github.com/resurfaceio/logger-go), [logger-nodejs](https://github.com/resurfaceio/logger-nodejs), [logger-ruby](https://github.com/resurfaceio/logger-ruby), [logger-lua](https://github.com/resurfaceio/logger-lua), [logger-dotnet](https://github.com/resurfaceio/logger-dotnet)

### Example: Demo app with network-sniffer as sidecar

Capturing API calls using our `network-sniffer` as a sidecar container works great when orchestrating different applications. In this example, we use `docker-compose` but you can also use [Kubernetes](https://resurface.io/docs#sniffer-daemonset), or any other orchestration tool.

- Run `docker compose up` in your terminal
- Go to http://localhost:7700 and log in to your Resurface instance
- Perform a few API calls to the `httpbin` service
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:80/json
    ```
- See the API calls flowing into the Resurface UI

To stop all containers:

```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

## Environment variables

All capture integrations by Resurface use two main environment variables:

- `USAGE_LOGGERS_URL` stores [the Resurface capture URL](https://resurface.io/docs#getting-capture-url), which by default should be
    ```
    http://localhost:7701/message
    ```
- `USAGE_LOGGERS_RULES` stores a set of rules used to filter sensitive info when logging API calls. [Learn more](#protecting-user-privacy)

The `network-sniffer` application uses two additional variables:

- `APP_PORTS` is a comma-separated list of integer values that correspond to the ports where your applications are being served in the host machine.
- `NET_DEVICE` corresponds to a specific network interface to capture packets from. When not set (or set to an empty string), the application captures from all available interfaces. You can get a list of all the available interfaces with the `ip a` (unix) or `ipconfig` (Windows) commands.

The `COMPOSE_PROFILES` environment variable sets the profile to use when no `--profle` option is passed when running `docker-compose -d up`

## VPC mirroring

### AWS

Capturing inbound and outbound traffic from the network interfaces that are attached to EC2 instances can be achieved with VPC mirroring. Click [here](https://resurface.io/aws-vpc-mirroring) for a step-by-step guide on how to set that up using AWS.

<img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_317E5894CD6185118CBDE74A3024EB5E9062F57EA81B0E96E18AC176C4C2EC4E_1658853675107_eks-mirroring-peering.png"  width="600">

Once you have created the traffic mirror session with its corresponding filter, the mirrored traffic is encapsulated in a VXLAN header. All VXLAN headers are associated with a 24-bit segment ID named VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) for a given VPC mirroring session. The target EC2 instance will receive the mirrored traffic on the IANA-assigned port, UDP port 4789.

Then, add the following lines to your `.env` file:

```bash
SNIFFER_ENGINE=vxlan
SNIFFER_MIRROR_VXLANPORT=4789
SNIFFER_MIRROR_VNIS=123
```

and run the `network-sniffer` container in the target EC2 instance:

```bash
docker run -d --name netsniffer --env-file .env --network host resurfaceio/network-sniffer:1.3.0
```

## Kubernetes

Resurface can deploy an instance of `network-sniffer` to every node in your Kubernetes cluster using a DaemonSet. This allows API calls to be captured without having to modify each workload. The sniffer DaemonSet is disabled by default, but can be enabled with a simple helm command:

```bash
helm upgrade -i resurface resurfaceio/resurface --namespace resurface --set sniffer.enabled=true --set sniffer.discovery.enabled=true --reuse-values
```

Our sniffer discovery feature automatically captures all API traffic as services start and stop within the cluster. However, if you already know which pods, services or labelled workloads you would like to capture from, it is recommended to specify those and turn off the discovery feature. To do so, you will need to create a `sniffer-values.yaml` file similar to the one in the example below:

```yaml
sniffer:
  enabled: true
  discovery:
    enabled: false
  logger:
    rules: include debug
  services:
  - name: service-a
    namespace: ns1
    ports: [ 8000, 3000 ]
  - name: service-b
    namespace: ns2
  pods:
  - name: apod-12345A
    namespace: podns1
    ports: [ 8080 ]
  - name: apod-12345B
    namespace: podns2
  labels:
  - keyvalues: [ "key1=value1","key2=value2","key4=value4" ]
    namespace: ns3
```

In this example, we have:
- A kubernetes service named `service-a` on a kubernetes namespace named `ns1`, exposing ports `8000` and `3000`
- A kubernetes service named `service-b` on a kubernetes namespace named `ns2`, exposing unknown ports (the sniffer will attempt to detect the exposed ports)
- A kubernetes pod named `apod-12345A` on a kubernetes namespace named `podns1`, exposing port `8080`
- A kubernetes pod named `apod-12345B` on a kubernetes namespace named `podns1`, exposing unknown ports
- An unspecified kubernetes workload labelled with three different key-value pairs (`"key1=value1","key2=value2","key4=value4"`) on a kubernetes namespace named `ns3`, exposing unknown ports


Use and replace the corresponding fields according to your specific case. For a complete reference on the values supported by the `resurfaceio/resurface` Helm chart, refer to the chart's [README](https://github.com/resurfaceio/containers/blob/v3.5.x/helm/resurfaceio/resurface/README.md).

Once you have your `sniffer-values.yaml` file, you can go ahead and perform the corresponding helm upgrade:

```bash
helm upgrade -i resurface resurfaceio/resurface --namespace resurface -f sniffer-values.yaml --reuse-values
```

Verify the you have as many `resurface-sniffer` pods in a running state as there are k8s nodes in your cluster:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n resurface | grep sniffer
```

## Protecting User Privacy

Loggers always have an active set of <a href="https://resurface.io/logging-rules">rules</a> that control what data is logged
and how sensitive data is masked. All of the examples above apply a predefined set of rules (`include debug`),
but logging rules are easily customized to meet the needs of any application.
